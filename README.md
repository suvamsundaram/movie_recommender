ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

A machine learningâ€“based recommender system that suggests movies to users based on similarity scores.
This project demonstrates how recommendation systems can be built using Python, data preprocessing, and similarity measures.

â¸»

ðŸš€ Features
	â€¢	Recommends movies based on user input (content-based filtering).
	â€¢	Uses cosine similarity / vectorization techniques for recommendation.
	â€¢	Interactive Jupyter Notebook (movie_recommender_system.ipynb) for experimentation.
	â€¢	Python script (app.py) for running the application.

â¸»

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
	â€¢	Python 3.x
	â€¢	Pandas, NumPy â€“ data manipulation
	â€¢	Scikit-learn â€“ vectorization & similarity computation
	â€¢	Streamlit / Flask (if applicable, update based on what you used)

 âš™ Installation & Usage
 1.	Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_recommender.git
    cd movie_recommender

 2.	Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

 3.	Run the app:
    python app.py
 (or streamlit run app.py if using Streamlit)

______

 ðŸ“Š How It Works
	1.	Load the dataset (movie metadata).
	2.	Process and vectorize text features such as genre, overview, keywords, cast, crew.
	3.	Compute similarity scores using cosine similarity.
	4.	Recommend top-N similar movies for a given input.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
	â€¢	Add collaborative filtering.
	â€¢	Deploy the app using Heroku / Streamlit Cloud.
	â€¢	Enhance UI for better user experience.
